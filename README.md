## Experiments

### Experiment 1
- **Models Used**: `SI-PINNs`, `LS-PINNs`
- **Purpose**: Evaluate and compare performance between SI-PINNs and LS-PINNs under the same conditions using the SIR model.

### Experiment 2
- **Models Used**: `PINNs`, `SI-PINNs`, `LS-PINNs`
- **Purpose**: Conduct comprehensive comparison among standard PINNs and its two variants to understand their strengths and weaknesses in SIR modeling tasks.
